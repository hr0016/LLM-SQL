- generate SQL from natural languages
- due to resources and computing cost reasons, the llm is based on the pretrained sql-expert model "defog-sqlcoder2" (for further reference, please check out defog.ai huggingface page https://huggingface.co/defog/sqlcoder2; or the newer smaller models https://huggingface.co/defog/sqlcoder-7b-2)
- no retraining or fine-tuning required, just prompt engineering 
- regardless of the schema of databases, so long as schema is provided to the LLM
- tested on various database schema and user input questions, reliability is consistent with testing scores provided by defog
- regardless of SQL engine, so long as you point out in the "notes" parameter what engine(s) are expected to be used
- added an interactive feature that enables the engine to generate improved output queries based on user feedback
- prototype provided; integratable into use cases associated to databses with CLIs and APIs 
- as per defog.ai: model is intended to be used by non-technical users to understand data inside their SQL databases. It is meant as an analytics tool, and not as a database admin tool.
- also as per defog.ai: this model has not been trained to reject malicious requests from users with write access to databases, and should only be used by users with read-only access.
